This is a ConfigMgr tool for aid in fixing problematic clients.
It launches remote processes on each client that has been identified as not connecting to ConfigMgr, monitors those processes and offers a web based interface to viewing client state.

This was created for a previous job I had as ConfigMgr administrator and is no longer in use, so I put it here for preserving it.
